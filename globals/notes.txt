Globals
------------
Built-in objects that are globally accessible : 

1 . Buffer
----------------------------|
2 . __dirname               |
3 . __filename              |
4 . exports                 |----> Seems to be global but are local to module
5 . module                  |
6 . require()               |
----------------------------|
7 . console
8 . process   
9 . global

Note : In Node their is no top level scope. Unlike in browsers, the top level 
scope is "window". Any thing declared with "var" at the top level is bound to
window scope. In Node it is different any thing declared with "var" within
a file(module) is global to that file only & is not accessible outside that
file. 

To make available to other file either we have to export the variable or 
declared it on the "global".

e.g. var name = "Sairam"; // local/global to that file.

global.name = "Sairam"; // Accessing through out all modules whoever includes
                        // that file(module)
