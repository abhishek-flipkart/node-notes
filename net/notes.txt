Net
--------------
Provides an asynchronous network API for creating stream-based TCP or IPC 
servers (net.createServer()) and clients (net.createConnection()).
Both server(net.Server) and client(net.Socket) implements EventEmitter and 
exposes certain events plus they have some methods also.

Their are two ways to create stream based server :
  1 . net.createServer(callback);
      Returns instance of net.Server;
      The callback gives socket.The socket exposes event using which we can 
      get data.
  
  2 . new net.Server();
      const server  = new net.Server();
      server.on('connection', callback)
      This callback also gives socket.
  
  
Similarly their are two ways to create stream based client: 
  1 . net.createConnection();
      Returns instance of net.Socket
      The socket exposes event using which we can get data.
  2 . new net.Socket();
